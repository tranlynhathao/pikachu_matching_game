## 5. Game Screen
### Rules:
- Players select 2 tiles with matching letters to remove, and there must be a path between the two letters. The number of connections should not exceed 3; otherwise, they cannot be connected. When there are no more tiles on the screen, the player wins.
- In Normal mode, the game operates normally without any changes.
- In Hard mode, when successfully removing any two tiles, the game will automatically move the last tile up to fill the space just cleared until all spaces are at the back and there are no spaces between the tiles. The rows also operate the same way.
    - SPECIAL: If you make one wrong selection, you will have to start over, meaning the screen will reset to the beginning of the game, so be careful, and you cannot UNDO if you get into this situation.
- In Fun mode, every time you select 2 tiles, whether right or wrong, the game will still randomly generate a new array and arrange the spaces like in Hard mode.
- Here, there will be sounds played when navigating and matching tiles in the game.

## 6. "Special" mode (Hidden mode)
- Hidden mode: In this mode, all tiles are hidden and only appear when you select them. You have to find 2 matching tiles to connect if possible. Keep trying!

## 7. Enter Giftcode
- Each mode will have a different gift code.
- Each time a gift code is entered, the complexity of the game will be reduced by half.
- Additionally, the game development team has added an interesting feature: pressing a secret key on the keyboard will remove 2 corresponding tiles.

## 8. Win
- This is a genre of game with ranking rules based on the time to complete the game, NOT a genre of game based on the number of points achieved each time two corresponding tiles are found. Winning the game and the song "Legends Never Die" will be played.
- If you’ve completed the game and reached this screen, congratulations! You’re a Pokémon and matching game enthusiast.
